During the COVID 19 crisis, the requirement of plasma became a high priority and the donor count has become low. Saving the donor information and helping the needy by notifying the current donors list, would be a helping hand. In regard to the problem faced, an application is to be built which would take the donor details, store them and inform them upon a request.
A patient who has fully recovered from COVID-19 can help patients currently fighting infection by donating plasma. Because it is an infection killer, the plasma now contains antibodies against COVID-19. These antibodies provided the immune system with one way to fight the virus when it was sick, so plasma can be used to fight diseases. Therefore, this paper monitoring recovering patients based on the clustering of data and classifying them using fuzzy hierarchical clustering to reach the plasma as soon as possible.

                                           PROJECT WORKFLOW:

 #The user interacts with the application.

 #Registers by giving the details as a donor.

 #The database will have all the details and if a user posts a request then the concerned blood group donors will get notified about it.
